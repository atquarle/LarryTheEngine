			<h4 align="left">Using the arrow keys to move, move your robber away from the cops.
			If two cops are adjacent to a robber, the robber will be caught and removed from the game.
			If all robbers are caught, the cops will win.
			If all of the robbers are not caught at the end of the time limit, the robbers win.
			If a robber only has one direction of movement, the cops can catch him by having just one cop adjacent.
			Arrows indicate the tile you will be placed on when moving to it.
			If you are unable to move, you may press spacebar to pass.</h4>
