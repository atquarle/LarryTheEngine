			<h4 align="left">For Online Multiplayer, the host must navigate to the online multiplayer option in the menu.
			When asked if they are the host, press ok. Then enter the hosting Id you would like to use.
			The other player will then navigate to the online multiplayer option.
			When asked if they are the host, press cancel and enter the hosts game id.
			Once the two peers are connected, the game will begin and both players can turn their snake using the arrow keys.
			<br><br>
			For Local Multiplayer player 1 uses the arrow keys and player 2 uses wasd to move.
			Guide the snakes to red colored pellets in order to grow.
			If left uneaten for too long, the red pellets will "rot" and become green.
			These pellets will cause your snakes to shrink.
			If a snake leaves the playzone, loses all its body segments, or crashes into another snake, the game is over.
			The snake that does not cause the game to end will be given a bonus 10 points.
			Whichever player has the most points at the end will be the winner.
			The game can be paused using the spacebar.</h4>
