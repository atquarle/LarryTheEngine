    <h1 align="center">Getting Started</h1>
	<h3 align="center"><font color="#000088">Where to Download</font></h3>
	<p>The whole engine can be pulled from the <a href="https://github.ncsu.edu/jahutche/LarryTheEngine">github repository</a>.
	Once pulled, the core engine is called "engine.js" and you will need to call it in your html before you call your game javascript.</p>
	<br>
	<h3 align="center"><font color="#000088">External Dependencies</font></h3>
	<p>This engine does all collision and physics based calculations on its own, so it doesn't rely on any external libraries like Box2D.</p>
	<br>
	<h3 align="center"><font color="#000088">File Organization</font></h3>
	<p>The "engine.js" file will can be kept wherever as long as you call it properly in your game's html.
	However, the texture folder needs to be in the same directory as the "engine.js" file.
	All of your sprites should be kept in your textures folder to be used properly.</p>
	<br>
	<h3 align="center"><font color="#000088">How to Get Started</font></h3>
	<p>Our engine creates the stage, canvas, and event listeners on its own, so the only thing needed to be setup when beginning
	is an update function and a draw function. A call to the engine function "startGame(deltaT)" needs to be made at the end of the
	file to start the game. Update will always happen before draw in the main callback.</p>
